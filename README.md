# NOT READY FOR USE

# autowrapped-cimgui

This is simply a package containing the raw bindings for cimgui.

It is not meant for direct consumption, instead it is to allow multiple library writers to develop different imgui abstractions without having to recreate the part they all have in common.

For more info on the thing this is wrapping please see https://github.com/ocornut/imgui
